# AeskEcho
Telemetry Mesh Network Project with 3 Arduino Nanos and 4 XBee Pro 868 to extend range.

###Workflow
* Device 3 is the main broadcaster. 3 sends data to 0, 1 and 2.
  * Message Format: "P3#dataNumber\r\n" 3 here is ID.
* Device 0 is the final destination. 1 and 3 sends data to it.
* Device 1 receives data from 2 and 3 and sends to 0.
  * If received from 3, renames the ID to 1.
* Device 2 receives from 3 and sends it to 1.
  * Renames ID to 2.
* Device 1, 2 and 3 are Arduino Nano. And respectively use AeskEcho# files.
* Device 0 was directly connected to laptop.

##XBee Configurations
Use XCTU to configure XBees. I had 4 Xbee Pro 868 devices.
 1. Factory reset all.
 2. ID = some number you like. Must be same on all.
 3. NO = 2.
 4. AP = 2.
 5. AO = 1.
 6. NI = Name you like, I named them like ROUTER3, ROUTER2.
 7. Note somewhere the SH and SL numbers, they are necessary to decide where you are sending stuff.
 8. BD = 115200.
 *Tip: Set PL to 0 (1 mW) if you are testing indoors otherwise these electromagnetic waves act weirdly and they dont communicate well. Even if you set it to 1 mW, you need to keep them away from each other for around 50cm to make sure they communicate healthly You can set them back to 300 mW for outdoors when the actual test time comes :).
